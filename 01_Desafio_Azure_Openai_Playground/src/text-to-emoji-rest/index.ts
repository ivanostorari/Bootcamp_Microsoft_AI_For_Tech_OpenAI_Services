  Analyze the supplied text and return a JSON array of objects containing unique unicode
  v15 emojis that best represent it. Each object in the array should contain the emoji,
  the markdown short code for the emoji, and the reasoning for choosing it. Do NOT return
  any duplicate emojis. JSON response should have a shape of: ${JSON.stringify(
